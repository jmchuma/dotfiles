Config stuff
============

Just some config I use for some of my computers.

Since there are some bits that are note mine I'm not going to put a
license on this one, but you can copy whatever you want.

If any the files here contains your code and you don't want it to be
here, please let me know.

Enjoy!


TODO
====
Create a script to install them:

  * must be stored in ~/.dotfiles? NO! Use pwd to get the current path
  * Links files to de ones under version control
  * MUST ask if i need to replace them or to rename them

Fuse bashrc (common code is common!)

  * if on osx do one thing
  * if on linux do another

Change "git_info" in bashrc to use "git status --porcelain"

Add whoami in bashrc to check if I'm using

  * See if "sudo -s" reloads bashrc
  * I'm a normla user ->  green red?
  * With have admin privileges -> red?
