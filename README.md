Config stuff
============

Just some config I use for some of my computers.

Since some bits are not originally mine and I don't remember which ones,
I'm not going to put a license on this one. Nonetheless, I think you can
safely copy whatever you want.

If any of the files here contains your code and you don't want it to be
here, please let me know.

Enjoy!


TODO
====
Create a script to install them:

  * must be stored in ~/.dotfiles? NO! Use pwd to get the current path
  * Links files to de ones under version control
  * MUST ask if i need to replace them or to rename them

Add whoami in bashrc color the prompt

  * See if "sudo -s" reloads bashrc
  * I'm a normla user ->  green red?
  * With have admin privileges -> red?
