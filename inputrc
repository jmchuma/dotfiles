# Incremental searching with Up and Down is configured in .inputrc
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward

# Old behaviour still available with Ctrl+P and Ctrl+N
# If that prevents Left and Right from working, fix them like this:
#"\e[C": forward-char
#"\e[D": backward-char

# There are other readline-based programs without this feature, so make it only apply in Bash:
#$if Bash
#  Space: magic-space
#$endif

# When listing possible file completions, put / after directory names and * after programs
set visible-stats on

# Cycling through potential completions is configured in .inputrc
# List the possible completions when Tab is pressed
#set show-all-if-ambiguous on
# Make Meta+S cycle through the list
#"\M-s": menu-complete
